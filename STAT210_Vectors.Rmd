##### **Chapter 20**

* Vectors are underlying components of tibbles

    + Most functions work with vectors

##### **Chapter 20.1**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


##### **Chapter 20.2**

* There are two types of vectors:

    + Atomic vectors, of which there are six types: logical, integer, double, character, complex, and raw. Integer and double vectors are collectively known as numeric vectors.

    + Lists, which are sometimes called recursive vectors because lists can contain other lists.

* NULL represents an empty vector
* NA represents an empty value

* Every vector has a type and length

##### **Chapter 20.3**

* The four most important types of atomic vector are logical, integer, double, and character. 

    + Raw and complex are rarely used during a data analysis, so I wonâ€™t discuss them here.

##### **Chapter 20.4**



##### **Chapter 20.5**

* Lists are a step up in complexity from atomic vectors, because lists can contain other lists

    + A very useful tool for working with lists is `str()` because it focusses on the structure, not the contents.

##### **Chapter 20.6**

* Any vector can contain arbitrary additional metadata through its attributes.

    + Names are used to name the elements of a vector.

    + Dimensions (dims, for short) make a vector behave like a matrix or array.

    + Class is used to implement the S3 object oriented system.

##### **Chapter 20.7**

* Factors and dates are augmented vectors

    + Factors are designed to represent categorical data that can take a fixed set of possible values
    
    + Dates in R are numeric vectors that represent the number of days since 1 January 1970.
    
    + Tibbles are augmented lists
